MAIN CHALLENGE

https://dms.sztaki.hu/bubi/#/app/home
The Municipality of Budapest made a decision in 2008 to establish a public bike-sharing scheme. 
The MOL Bubi system went live in September 2014 with 1100 bicycles and 76 docking stations. 
You can use MOL Bubi day and night, with annual, semi-annual, and quarterly passes or one, three and seven day tickets. 
In the challenge, you are given 5 months of data to predict usage patterns in three tasks, 
two for predictive analytics and one for open research. 
The data contains information about every MOL Bubi travel during this period, 
such as the source and destination stations and the starting and ending time. 
The data of some of the days are set aside for evaluation.




MINI CHALLENGE
--------------------------------------------------------
A classification problem, based on the docking station demand problem. 
If the maximum demand (see Task 2) is high for a given station on a given day, the target label is 1, 0 otherwise. 
Your task is to predict the target label.
